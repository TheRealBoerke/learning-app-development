# Darts Game - 501

## Game

**Board**

The board is divided into areas, where each area is worth points from 1 through 20.

The board is also divided into rings:

* The area in the middle is called the bull. The red center is called the Double Bull, or Bull's Eye, the green ring around it is called the Single Bull, or just Bull. Points are 25 for a single bull and 50 for a bull's eye.
* The ring around the bull is often called Small Single in other games designed to improve accuracy, but is a single and implies a point multiplication of 1 (so S20 = 20 points).
* The ring around the *small single* is called the Triple ring. Multiply the scores by 3 (T20 = 60 points).
* Next comes the Large Single ring, same as the Small Single, only larger in size.
* And lastly, the Double Ring, which doubles the points. (D20 = 40 points)

Goal of the game is to reach a score of 0 (zero) ending on a double point score. So Double Bull or any other double.

**Game setup**

Before starting a game of 501 the following information is needed:

* Player names (2 of them)

## Game play

### Starting the game

* Each player starts at a score of 501 (game score)
* Players throw in turn (starting with P1)

### Turn 1

* Player 1 throws a dart, and the turn score is retracted from their game score (3x)
* Turn switches to Player 2, who does the same

Missing the board equals 0 points

### Turn 2 - ...

* P1 is back at the oche and throws another three darts, scores are deducted from their gamescore.
* Turn switches to P2 

Each throw a check is done to see if the score can be finished using the remaining throws in that turn.

### Finishing

As soon as a score can be checked out (in a game with a "double out" requirement) with the remaining darts, the player can attempt to win the game.

Valid checkouts for a double-out game are those that are less than, or equal to, 170 with the exception of 169, 168, 166, 165, 163, 163 and 159. 

To win, players need to reach exactly 0 on a double. If they don't, they can either try again with the new game score (which is most likely another checkout opportunity, but doesn't have to be) or they bust.

In a double-out game, players bust when their game score after a turn:

* Reaches 1 (can't be divided by 2), or
* Reaches 0, but not on a double
* Is negative (< 0)

### Single player run-through

Let's look at a single player's run to see this in "action":

| **Turn** | Throw | Result \| Points        | Score |
| -------- | ----- | ----------------------- | ----- |
| -        | -     | -                       | 501   |
| 1        | 1     | T20 \| 60 points        | 441   |
|          | 2     | T20 \| 60 points        | 381   |
|          | 3     | S20 \| 20 points        | 361   |
| 2        | 1     | T20 \| 60 points        | 301   |
|          | 2     | T20 \| 60 points        | 241   |
|          | 3     | T20 \| 60 points        | 181   |
| 3        | 1     | T20 \| 60 points        | 121   |
|          | 2     | T17 \| 51 points        | 70    |
|          | 3     | D15 \| 30 points        | 40    |
| 4        | 1     | MISS                    | 0     |
|          | 2     | T20 \| 60 points (BUST) | 40    |
| 5        | 1     | S20                     | 20    |
|          | 2     | D10                     | 0     |

The first three turns are pretty straight forward. No check-out option, so simply count down.

The fourth turn, the player first misses the double, throwing outside the double ring. He overshoots his target score and busts, 

On the fifth turn player misses the first double, and hits it after the second, causing his game score to land on 0 and triggering the win.
