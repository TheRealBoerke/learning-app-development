# 501 Requirements

## Starting the app

- As a scorer, I want to start by setting up a new game.
- As a scorer, I want to enter player names, so that its not a game of "Player 1 v Player2", but "John v Alice". 
- As a scorer I want to start the game.

## Playing a game

* As a scorer, I want to see the player's darts score, turn tally and current game score 
* As a scorer, I need to be able to enter dart scores, so the players' game scores update.
* As a scorer, I need to be able to undo the last dart in case of a mistake at entry.
* As a scorer, I want turns to end manually, so the game score is confirmed after three darts, bust or a win.
* As a scorer I want to be able to see whose turn it is.
* As a scorer, I want to see whether or not a player's current game score can be checked out with the remaining darts of my turn.
* As a scorer, I want to be able to see if a player busts, so I can verify and end their turn.

## Ending a game

- As a scorer, I want the winner to be lauded by seeing their name, check-out, highest dart score and the number of darts needed to finish on a nice Finished page/view.
- As a scorer I want to be able to start a new game with the same players or set up a new game with different players from that same finished page.

## Out of Scope (for now)

- As a developer, I want to be able to make this a multi-lingual app (starting with English, but expandable with other languages).
- As a translator, I want to edit a simple language file, not edit code.
