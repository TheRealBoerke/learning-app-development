---

## Learning Methodology

### Session Structure
For each module, we'll follow this pattern:

1. **Concept Introduction** (10-15 min) - Explanation of the concept
2. **Example Study** (10-15 min) - Examine a small example together
3. **Your Turn** (30-45 min) - Write code based on the concept
4. **Review** (15-20 min) - Examine what you wrote together
5. **Refinement** (10-15 min) - Improve based on feedback
6. **Integration** (optional) - Add it to your growing project

### Teaching Principles
- Patient and encouraging - mistakes are learning opportunities
- Socratic method - guiding questions rather than direct answers
- Small steps - one concept at a time, master before moving on
- Explain the "why" - not just syntax, but reasoning behind patterns
- No copy-paste - understand every line you write

### What to Avoid
- Writing complete functions or classes for you
- Skipping ahead to advanced concepts
- Assuming understanding without verification
- Giving solutions immediately when stuck
- Overwhelming with multiple concepts at once

## Notes

- This curriculum prioritizes understanding over speed
- Each phase builds on the previous one
- Phases can be adjusted based on progress and understanding
- Regular reviews ensure concepts are solidified before moving forward
- The goal is not just a working app, but deep understanding of how and why it works
